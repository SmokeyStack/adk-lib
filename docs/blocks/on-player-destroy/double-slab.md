# adk_lib:on_player_destroy_double_slab

## What does it do?

This component will spawn the destroyed slab as an item form if the tool has the silk touch enchantment. This is to workaround the fact that silk touch ignores the `minecraft:loot` component.

## How to use

Add `"adk_lib:on_player_destroy_double_slab": {}` to your block json file.
